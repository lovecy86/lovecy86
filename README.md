#### An Educator reskilling to Data Analyst
Hi there,
I'm Lovecy Thomas. I have 6 years experience as a college tutor. During my tenure, I was more inclined towards problematic subjects, such as, Signals and Systems , Signal Processing and Control Systems, which required a lot of analytical thinking. In addition, I was also responsible for maintaining student's records and progress. Being a class teacher, I had to analyse each student's performance and implement necessary corrective measures. I want to implement my these skills in the world of data that is dynamic. I am currently enrolled in Data Analytics Boothcamp, to actively enhance my skills in data analysis and visualization  through hands on projects.

Skills: Excel/Matlab/Labview
